Get a list of all assets then show them on the website without icons so you know which ones you have

We will group assets for all the different blockchains so it shows as a list imagine:

- ETH:
-- Ethereum: 1.2 ETH
-- BSC: 2.3 ETH
-- Polygon: 0.4 ETH

So you can get a very good idea of what assets you have and where.

1. Get a list of all your assets
2. Then, one by one check where they are located. So if it's ethereum, we get all the chains with amount > 0 and return
and object that looks like this:

{
    assets: [
        {
            asset: {
                name: 'eth',
                chains: [
                    {
                        chain: 'ethereum',
                        balance: 1.2,
                    },
                    {
                        chain: 'bsc',
                        balance: 2.3,
                    },
                    {
                        chain: 'polygon',
                        balance: 0.4,
                    },
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}

3. Make sure to not count the assets where the amount is zero.
4. Display that in the website.
